          <li>
            Performed Control and coordination of activities engaged in transmission of electric power between intermediate substations and distributing sections 
            such as, monitoring and regulation of Power, Current, Voltage and Power factor of EHV and HV Power Transmission lines and Power Grid with voltages ranging 
            from 11kV to 110kV. 
            Planning and establishing Load shedding when load demand increases or generation drops.
          </li>
            <li>
              Performed inspection on EHV Substation equipment, structures and materials along with operation and control of electric power and fault sensitivity 
              like, frequently monitoring oil levels of Transformer and MOCB, Temperature gauges, looking for abnormalities like arcing or tear in Busbar,
              ACSR bare conductors, Manual isolators, XLPE cable ends, Disc insulators, Relay flags, etc.
              Measurement of Insulation resistance (IR value) of all equipment using 0-5kV IR Meter.

            <li>
                Creating and updating the log of operational activities, maintenance schedule, safety inspections, planning and execution of shutdown maintenance.
                For example, log of Energy import and Export(MWH), Availability of feeder and Transformer, feeder tripping, Switch off, issuing permit to work 
                by manually Removing VCB(vacuum circuit breaker) from panel for 11 kV or by opening isolators and circuit breakers for EHV and also provide earthing,
                routine daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly and annual check-ups, executing total shutdown by isolating all means of supply to the station premises,
                arranging backup supply for control room, back feeding arrangements for 11 kV feeders to avoid power outage.
            </li>
            <li>
              Timely maintenance of equipment like Power Transformer, Circuit breaker (VCB, MOCB, SF6), Control and Relay panel, HV&EHV feeder by implementing 
              different tests such as SC/OC tests on Transformer, Dissolved Gas analysis (DGA) and Breakdown voltage test (BDV) on Transformer oil, Filtration of oil.
              Ensuring proper operation of Buchholz relay, SIEMENS and MICOM(ALSTORM) numerical relays and JVS electromechanical relay. 
              Performing IR value tests on CB, LA (Lightning arrester), Transformer Bushings, VCB truck, XLPE cables etc.

            <li>
              With efficient and spontaneous decision making power availability of EHV feeders increased to 99% from 96%.Also Witnessed and Participated 
              in Design and construction of new 220kV GIS (gas insulated switchgear) substation from foundation like building of structural base column
              Earth resistance measurement, construction of Earth mat, etc to installation and commissioning of equipment in GIS chamber later filled with SF6 gas
              100MVA 220/110 kV transformers, 20MVA 110/11 kV transformers, PLC-SCADA automation control and so on.
